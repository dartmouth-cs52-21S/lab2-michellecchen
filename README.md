# Buzzfeed-esque quiz: ðŸŒŸ "WHICH GOD OF THEROS ARE YOU?" ðŸŒŸ

I certainly don't play *Magic: The Gathering*, but I know a couple people who do. To entertain them, I read through the guidebook and decided to make a quiz featuring the gods from the fictional, Greek-inspired universe, 'Theros.'

Some of them, at least.

## What Worked Well

Most everything was pretty straightforward. After getting a grasp on flexboxes from the previous lab, it was easy to understand how to hierarchically organize my quiz with said flexboxes. On the uppermost level, I'd have the quiz; contained within that, quiz questions; and contained within those, quiz options. Vertical, vertical, horizontal: by appropriately providing these orientations to `flex-direction`, getting the layout right for this assignment was simple.

The provided modal tutorial in the instructions also helped greatly with all things popup-related.

I had a really fun time working with the design of this quiz, which is why I decided to go the CSS-heavy route: adding a shimmer effect, for one. Consulting various online tutorials and then optimizing them for my quiz was fun and taught me a lot of neat tricks.

## What Didn't (but eventually did)

I ran into trouble with styling the quiz options that went unselected by the user. Initially, I had it such that every option, prior to any option being selected, would have its opacity reduced, etc. The selected option was appropriately styled, but I didn't want everything to be hard to see pre-selection. I only wanted to apply that opacity reduction *after* selection, not before.

I had to play around with this, but eventually, I figured it out. By assigning every radio button in a quiz question, upon one of those buttons being selected, the `unselected` class â€” and then manually removing that class from only the selected button â€” I was able to reduce opacity post-selection, and not pre-selection.

Another thing was that the text in the subheaders above each question was, at first, hard to read. It bothered me greatly. But by adding a white `text-shadow` to the words, illuminating them with a sort of halo, they became much more readable.
